Tools for Handling Extraction of Features from Time series (theft)

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `theft` from CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("theft")
```

You can install the development version of `theft` from GitHub using the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/theft")
```

Please also check out our paper [Feature-Based Time-Series Analysis in R using the theft Package](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06146) which discusses the motivation and theoretical underpinnings of `theft` and walks through all of its functionality using the [Bonn EEG dataset](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.64.061907) --- a well-studied neuroscience dataset.

## General purpose

`theft` is a software package for R that facilitates user-friendly access to a structured analytical workflow for the extraction, analysis, and visualisation of time-series features. As of `v0.5.4`, `theft` now acts as a 'mothership' one-stop-shop package ecosystem which calls several other smaller, more bespoke packages:

Users are encouraged to either use `theft` to access all the functionality, or, if they require only specific functions, to explore the individual packages. That being said, `theft` provides a structured workflow for taking users from data import through to detailed insights about their temporal data. This structured workflow is presented in the graphic below:

As you can see from the graphic above, `theft` contains a convenient and extensive suite of tools for semi-automated processing of extracted features (including data quality assessments and normalisation methods), low dimensional projections (linear and nonlinear), data matrix and feature distribution visualisations, time-series classification procedures, statistical hypothesis testing, and various other statistical and graphical tools. `theft` currently facilitates access to $>1200$ time-series features.
